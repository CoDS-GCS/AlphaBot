# keys: You have to save the keys needed for Dialogflow API.

This directory is used to save the keys that are needed to connect to Dialogflow API. The keys are ignored in the
.gitignore file. You have to change the key name in `Dialogflow-RQ1.py` and `Dialogflow-RQ2.py` files based on your key
file.
